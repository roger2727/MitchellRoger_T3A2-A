Users can also rate and comment on recipes, and get feedback and suggestions from other users.

# **Implementation plan**

So, in our project, we decided to use Trello to manage and delegate tasks among the team members. Trello is a visual tool that makes it easy to organize and track tasks. At the start of the project, we all had a meeting to discuss and assign tasks to each team member. Each team member was responsible for a specific task, which was added to the "To-Do" card on Trello. This card listed all the tasks that needed to be completed for the project.

As we started working on the tasks, we would drag the task from the "To-Do" card to our assigned card on Trello. This way, the team could see who was responsible for each task and the progress of each task. Once we completed a task, we would move it from our assigned card to the "Completed" card on Trello. This helped us keep track of what had been done and what still needed to be done.

Overall, this process allowed for clear communication and organization within the team, and helped us ensure that all tasks were completed in a timely manner. It also allowed each of us to focus on our specific tasks and not get overwhelmed by the entire project.
